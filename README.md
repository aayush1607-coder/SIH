## Crop Disease Prediction App

This Streamlit app allows you to upload an image of a crop and get a prediction for the possible crop disease it might be suffering from. The app utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model loaded from a pickle file.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x (Make sure to check the specific version required by your model)
* Streamlit
* Pickle
* OpenCV-Python

**Installation:**

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Activate your virtual environment.
3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pickle opencv-python
   ```

4. Replace `cnn_disease.pkl` in the code with the actual path to your model file.

**Usage:**

1. Run the app using:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Upload an image of the crop you want to analyze.
3. The app will display the predicted crop disease.

**Note:**

* This app is a basic example and might require further customization depending on your specific model and requirements.
* The accuracy of the predictions might vary based on the quality of the uploaded image and the training data used for the model.
